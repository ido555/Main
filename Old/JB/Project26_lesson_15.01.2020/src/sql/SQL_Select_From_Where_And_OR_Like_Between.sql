 SELECT * FROM employees
-- where id >= 6 -- <> different than
-- where id > 6 -- AND, OR id -- where id smaller or larger than 6
-- where id < 6 and job_title = 'Sales MaNaGer'; -- text = ' ' -- ' ' is not case sensitive by default
-- = instead of == in java
-- where = kinda like if
-- select first , last name from employees
-- select first_name, last_name from employees;
-- select company, last_name, first_name, id,job_title from employees;
-- select * from employees
-- where id between 2 and 4;
-- where id >=2 and id <= 4 does the same thing
-- select * from employees
-- where id = 1 or id = 3 or id = 9;
-- where id in (1, 3, 9); --   better way to do this
-- where first_name = 'Anne';
-- where first_name like 'A%' -- % - infinte chars
-- where first_name like '%a%'; -- contains (chars or nothing at all)'a'(chars or nothing at all) anywhere
where first_name like '_a_' -- underscore represents one char 
-- not = like !(boolen) in java
-- w3schools.com/sql    - good reference
